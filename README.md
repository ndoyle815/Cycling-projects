# Cycling-projects
I plan to populate this repository with data analysis projects for exploring UCI professional road cycling data.

stages_TDF.csv is an augmented dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ralle360/historic-tour-de-france-dataset) detailing historic data of Tour de France stages. I have updated the dataset to include recent stages from the 2018-2022 editions of the prestigious race.
